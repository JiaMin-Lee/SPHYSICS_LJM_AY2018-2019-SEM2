From SPHYSICS

These codes are taken from SPHYSICS and some modifications are made to these existing codes. This is an attempt at changing the
codes so that it does not reflect effects of gravity.

The modifications made in SPHYSICS2D are as follows:
1. correct_2D.f : gravity term has been removed [grz has been removed when calculating wdot(i)]
2. EoS_Morris_2D.f : changed the code
